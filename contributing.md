## Adding new features

The first place to look to start adding things to LampQ/Y is to create a new display mode.

Here are some very basic guidelines

* When writing your code, please try to follow a similar style of the code in the file you are changing.

   * typedef is your friend, end your typedef'd type with a `_t` 

* When you send a pull request, please open an issue explaining what you are adding, and then submit the pull request

* Please add yourself to the CONTRIBUTORS.md file as part of your change, listing what you added.

It's just me right now, so please give me a little time to merge your pull requests.

# Documentation

Right now, the documentation is just the README.md files in various places.  This could be better.  How about writing
a wiki page?  I'll love you forever if you do!

# Community 

Not a developer but are using LampQ/Y for a project, send me a link, I'd love to see it!
